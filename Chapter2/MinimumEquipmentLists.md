## 39. MINIMUM EQUIPMENT LISTS

39.1. Operators shall not operate aircraft with unserviceable equipment, except under the approval granted by the Authority. Such Approval will be granted only after the content of the proposed Minimum Equipment List (MEL) has been vetted and found acceptable by the Airworthiness Office and Flight Operations Office.

39.2. The introduction to any MEL must contain a statement reminding the aircraft commander of his responsibility to ensure that the aircraft is in every way fit for the intended flight, and that he may apply a higher minimum standard if, in his opinion, it is necessary to do so in order to secure the safe operation of the aircraft.

39.3. MELs must be submitted to the Airworthiness Office at the time of an application for an AOC or a variation which covers the introduction of a new aircraft type, as should instructions and guidance to commanders on the operation of aircraft with deferred defects. The content of operatorsâ€™ MELs may not be less restrictive than that of the associated Master Minimum Equipment List (MMEL). Should an MMEL become more restrictive due to amendment action, operators must amend their MELs similarly.

39.4. When the carriage of unserviceable equipment results in a deviation from the normal drills, satisfactory alternative drills must be specified in the manual. For example, when thrust reversers are listed as minimum equipment, the operator must publish alternative drills.

39.5. The MEL should also include information on Configuration Deviation List (CDL).
